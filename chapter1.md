# 1. Introduction to AVR Micro-controllers

ATMEL introduced the AVR family of micro-controllers in 1996. Since then several versions have been produced, also thanks the big success of the Arduino project. In 2003 ATMEL had already shipped about 500 million AVR micro-controllers, at the time of writing this number is probably much bigger.

AVR micro-controllers use a RISC (reduced instruction set) command set using a modified Harward architecture. As of today the AVR family contains many different products ranging from ultra-low power 8-bit micro-controllers, to high performance 32-bit ARM controllers.

In this book, we will focus on the tinyAVR 8-bit familiy: they are relatively cheap (few dollars to few cents in quantities) and very powerful as we'll discover during the book.
