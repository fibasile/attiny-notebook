ATTiny Crash Course
=======

This book is a practical introduction to the AVR family of micro-controllers, with a specific focus on the ATTiny44/84 and ATTiny45/85 models.

The book is targeted at students enrolled in the [Fab Academy](http://fabacademy.org),  a distributed learning program offered by the [Fab Lab Network](http://fabfoundation.org).

Anyone with a basic understanding of embedded programming and micro-controllers can find it useful too.

The content is organized as follows:

**Chapter One: Introduction to AVR micro-controllers**

This chapter provides an overview of the AVR features, describing the general architecture and basic tools needed to program and test AVR programs.

**Chapter Two: Building your AVR test board**

This chapter goes through the process necessary to build your own AVR board using tools commonly found in Fab Labs.

**Chapter Three: Programming the AVR**

This chapter guides the reader in setting up the programming environment and using the AVRDude software to load a firmware on the evaluation board.

**Chapter Four: I/O ports**

This chapter shows how to program the AVR in order to read and write from I/O ports, configuring the I/O registers and wiring simple devices such as buttons and LEDs.

**Chapter Five: Serial communication**

This chapter describes serial communication options, including RS232, SPI and I2C.

**Chapter Six: Interrupts and Timers**

This chapter shows how to create Timers and how to use interrupts for checking input devices.

**Chapter Seven: PWM, Fading Leds, and Servo Motors**

This chapter goes through the PWM generation options useful for controlling servo motors.

**Chapter Eight: Reading analog signals with the ADC**

This chapter describes the ADC subsystem and how you can use it for reading analog signals.

**Chapter Nine: Networking**

This chapter shows the different networking options for AVR micro-controllers including Bluetooth and WiFi.
