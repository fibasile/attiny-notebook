ATTiny Crash Course
=======

This book is intended as an in-depth introduction to the AVR family of microcontrollers, with a specific focus on the ATTiny44/84 and ATTiny45/85.

The main audience for the book is students enrolled in the Fab Academy distributed learning program offered by the Fab Foundation and led by Neil Gershenfeld,
but anyone with a basic understanding of embedded programming and microcontrollers could find it as useful.

The content is organized as follows:

**Chapter One: Introduction to AVR microcontrollers**

This chapter provides an overview of the AVR features, describing the general architecture and basic tools needed to program and test AVR programs.

**Chapter Two: Building your AVR test board**

This chapter goes through the process necessary to build your own AVR board using tools commonly found in Fab Labs.

**Chapter Three: Programming the AVR**

This chapter guides the reader in setting up the programming environment and using the avrdude software to load a firmware on the AVR board.

**Chapter Four: I/O ports**

This chapter shows how to program the AVR in order to read and write from I/O ports, configuring the I/O registers and wiring simple devices such as buttons and LEDs.

**Chapter Five: Serial communication**

This chapter describes serial communication options, including RS232, SPI and I2C.

**Chapter Six: Interrupts and Timers**

This chapter shows how to create Timers and how to use interrupts for checking input devices.

**Chapter Seven: PWM, Fading Leds, and Servo Motors**

This chapter goes through the PWM generation options, especially useful for controlling servo motors.

**Chapter Eight: Reading analog signals with the ADC**

This chapter describes the ADC subsystem and how it can be used for reading analog signals.

**Chapter Nine: Networking**

This chapter shows the various networking options for AVR microcontrollers, including Bluetooth and Wifi.
